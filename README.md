# Dinosaur-Rex-
A collection of stories about a young dinosaur named Rex

One bright day in the valley Rex went looking for some new friends.
Most dinos like firends about their own size, it makes games like foursquare and tether ball farmore enjoyable...and possible.
But in his valley Rex is as big as they come, so suffice it to say, his birthday parties have been some lonsome events the last few years.
